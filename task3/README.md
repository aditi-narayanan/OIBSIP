1.)To perform an SQL injection attack on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) using a shell script with sqlmap, you first need to start the Metasploit virtual machine and open DVWA in a browser such as Mozilla Firefox using the VM's IP address.<br/>2.)After logging in with default credentials (admin / password), navigate to the "DVWA Security" tab and set the security level to "Low".<br/>3.)Then, go to the "SQL Injection" section, enter a numeric ID in the input field (like 1), but do not submit it yet.<br/>4.)Next, configure your browser to use a proxy by setting it to manual configuration with the HTTP proxy set to 127.0.0.1 and port 8080.<br/>5.)Launch Burp Suite and make sure intercept is turned on.Now submit the ID in DVWA, and Burp Suite will intercept the HTTP request.<br/>6.)In the intercepted request, copy the full URL (including parameters like id=1&Submit=Submit) and the session cookie from the headers.<br/>7.)Use these two pieces of information to run your shell script by executing the command: ./sql_injection_exploit.sh "<intercepted_url>" "<copied_cookie>".<br/>8.)The purpose of the sql_injection_exploit.sh script is to automate an SQL injection attack on the vulnerable DVWA endpoint using sqlmap.<br/>9.)The script first checks if exactly two arguments are providedâ€”the target URL and the session cookie. If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.<br/>10.)It then stores the first argument as the URL and the second as the cookie.<br/>11.)These variables are then used to construct a sqlmap command that performs the actual attack.<br/>12.)The -u flag is used to specify the URL that contains the vulnerable SQL injection parameter (such as id=1&Submit=Submit), and the --cookie flag provides the session cookie necessary to authenticate the request as a logged-in user.<br/>13.)The --batch option ensures that sqlmap runs in non-interactive mode, automatically accepting default choices for any prompts, which makes the script suitable for automated use.<br/>14.)Finally, the --dbs option tells sqlmap to enumerate and list all the databases present on the backend database server if the injection is successful.<br/>15.)Overall, the script simplifies the process of conducting an SQL injection attack by combining required input validation, session handling, and payload execution in a single automated command.
